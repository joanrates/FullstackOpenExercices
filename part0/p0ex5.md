# Part0 Exercice 5

The procedure at the beginning of the application is the same as in the previous case. The server sends firs the HTML; it requests the CSS and the JavaScript. When that last document is getting evaluated, it calls for the JSON where all the data is stored. The main difference between the single-page application and the multiple-page application comes after the user sends the form into the server.

    activate server
    server-->>browser: spa HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: main.css
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: spa.js
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server
```
